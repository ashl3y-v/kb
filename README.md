Pronounced: cert (as in certify) my (as in my snake, the snake which is mine)

For the entire board and the multiple variations available (including numrow flip and symbols for qwerty) refer to the xkb configuration file

The symbol alterations are what I believe will be helpful in programming (specifically the languages I use, you might want something different)

I have both qwerty, qwerty with srtmy symbols, and srtmy, the first as a backup and also because I need the numrow to switch, the second to help me learn the symbols even if I'm not ready to use srtmy yet,
